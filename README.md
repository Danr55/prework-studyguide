## Description

I have always wanted to learn how to code, and this prework study guide is a great way to initiate this process. It serves as a great way to get my feet in and start learning what i have always been interested and have found to be very intriguing. I have learned the basics of HTML,CSS, and Javascript as well as Git and Github, The ability to save projects onto the "cloud" and then later on add them onto your main source of code.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
